iOS Crash Course
================

This course is very heavily based on [NatashaTheRobot](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot)'s
[Mobile App Development Crash Course](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/MobileAppDevelopmentCrashCourse).
(I subbed for her course, and adapted it somewhat).


How To Use This Repository
--------------------------

Read through the tutorial PDFs: [Day 1](Day 1.pdf), [Day 2](Day 2.pdf), and
[Supplemental](Supplemental.pdf). They are intended to run you very quickly
through the process of building an iOS app that touches many concepts and
components that you encounter when building most apps.

The tutorial PDFs are light on explanation, however (on purpose). Don't be
afraid to poke aroud the documentation, Google, Stack Overflow, and the like to
get deeper explanations of the code and components that you encounter!

Each chapter of the tutorial is associated with a [git branch](https://github.com/nevir/ios-crash-course/branches?merged=1).
You can check out each branch, if you want to see the code that completes that
chapter, or would like to skip ahead.
